```
while ( A is not finished || B is not finished )
    A's current bit
    B's current bit

    sum = current bit of A + current bit of B + carry

    current bit = sum % 10;
    carry = sum / 10;

Determine if there are still carries

```

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        dummy=cur=ListNode(0)  #create dummy node for returned list.cur always points to current bit
        carry=0
        
        while l1 or l2:
            x=l1.val if l1 else 0   #if condiction makes sure l1 is not null
            y=l2.val if l2 else 0   #if condiction makes sure l2 is not null
            
            s=x+y+carry             #calculate sum
            res=s%10                #calculate res
            cur.next=ListNode(res)  #create new ListNode with res as the value
            cur=cur.next            #move cursor to the Node we just created
            carry=s//10
            
            if l1:l1=l1.next        #if l1!=Null then l1 can goes to the next node
            if l2: l2=l2.next
        if (carry!=0):              #if the carry!=0, add carry to the last node
            cur.next=ListNode(carry)
        return dummy.next
            
        
```

**Note: Since we are returning ListNodes, cur.next should point to the new Node with res as the value**
